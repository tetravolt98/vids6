How does Kamala Harris plan to tackle racial inequalities?
    
Oh, Kamala Harris! When I first really tuned into her story, it felt like diving into a captivating novel. I had just finished watching the debates leading up to the 2020 election, and she absolutely lit up the stage. Her fierce intelligence and no-nonsense attitude caught my attention. I distinctly remember her exchanges; she was unafraid to challenge her opponents with articulate clarity, and I found myself leaning forward, hanging on to every word.But what resonated even more was her incredible background—born to Indian and Jamaican immigrants, she became the first woman, the first Black woman, and the first person of South Asian descent to hold the office of the Vice President. It was as if she was rewriting not just her own narrative, but a larger national narrative as well. There was this one moment during her campaign when she spoke about her mother’s journey, and how she taught Kamala to fight for what’s right. I felt a shiver; it was a moment that connected deeply with so many of us. It made me think about my own influences and the legacies passed down through generations—my grandmother's stories of resilience still echo in my heart.Now, as Vice President, I can’t help but wonder: what will be her defining moment in this role? Will it be a groundbreaking decision on healthcare or perhaps a bold international move? Every day feels pivotal, and I’m on the edge of my seat, waiting to see how she will shape history next. What do you think her biggest challenge will be moving forward?
