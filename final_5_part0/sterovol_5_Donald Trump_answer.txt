How did Donald Trump respond to the COVID-19 pandemic?
    
Ah, Donald Trump, a figure who always seems to elicit strong reactions, doesn’t he? I remember the first time I really paid attention to him—back in 2004 when he was the star of "The Apprentice." Seeing him strut around the boardroom with that iconic catchphrase “You’re fired!” made me think he was just a charismatic businessman. But the deeper I dug, the more layers I found. Years later, I watched him announce his candidacy for president in 2016. It felt like watching a rollercoaster begin its ascent; the energy was palpable! The way he captivated crowds, often with controversial statements, ignited so many debates among my friends and family. I couldn’t help but be fascinated by the stark divisions he seemed to create.What struck me most was the unpredictability. Just when you thought you had him figured out, he’d throw a curveball—like when he took a very public stance on immigration or spoke out against NATO allies. Conversations would flare up—with tension rising and people passionately arguing their points. I even found myself jumping in, trying to make sense of it all.But here's the twist: I recently stumbled upon an old interview where Trump shared his dreams of creating a worldwide business dynasty and, for a flicker of a moment, I saw him as more than just a polarizing figure. I thought, what if there's more behind that brash exterior? What motivates someone to want that kind of power?What do you think drives a person like him—ambition, ego, or something deeper? I’d love to hear your thoughts!
