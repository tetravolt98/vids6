0	1140	Ah, Donald Trump.
1900	3160	What a fascinating figure.
3740	6440	I recall the first time I really started to pay attention to him.
7040	9740	It was years ago, during his run on the apprentice,
10120	12820	I remember thinking he was just this larger than life character,
13360	16620	almost like a caricature of a businessman, his catchphrase,
17040	18900	you're fired, echoed in my brain,
19380	22040	a mix of authority and flair that was hard to resist.
22780	24920	Fast forward to the 2016 election,
25340	27360	and it was all anyone could talk about.
28000	29640	The man didn't just break the mold,
30000	31480	he seemed to shatter it entirely.
32100	34200	I found myself entangled in conversations
34200	38260	that spiraled into late-night debates about policies and personality.
38900	42940	But mostly personality, he was like a magnet, pulling people in,
43440	46880	sparking emotions, ranging from admiration to outright fury.
47300	49500	I vividly remember the night he won the presidency.
50040	53400	I was at a friend's house, the TV blaring, tensions high.
54020	56700	You could feel the collective gasp of disbelief in the room
56700	57880	as the results rolled in.
58320	60880	Some were cheering, others were stunned into silence.
61320	62900	It felt like being on a roller coaster,
63380	66500	gripping the safety bar, not knowing whether to scream or laugh.
67260	69640	But here's the thing that often gets overshadowed
69640	72180	in the whirlwind of his presidency in public persona.
72820	75100	How does a person keep that intensity going?
75620	78000	Trump's ability to stay at the forefront of news
78000	81200	and national conversations is almost magical.
81700	84000	I often wonder, what's next for him?
84720	86640	Will he dive back into reality TV?
87220	89060	Or is there another unexpected twist
89060	90560	waiting just around the corner?
91000	92080	Would love to hear your thoughts.
