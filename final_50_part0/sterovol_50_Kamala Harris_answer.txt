What are Kamala Harris's views on the minimum wage?
    
Oh, Kamala Harris! Every time I think of her, I’m reminded of that stunning moment during the 2020 vice presidential debate when she took a fierce stand against Mike Pence. Her confidence was palpable, and when she called out his record on issues like health care and women’s rights, I could feel the tension crackle through the TV screen. It was as if she was not just fighting for herself but for every woman who has ever felt underestimated.What I find so fascinating about her is not just her role as vice president but her journey. Growing up in a mixed-race family, she faced hurdles that many can relate to—trying to find a place in the world while also honoring her heritage. When she talks about how her mother raised her to believe in her own power, I can't help but think of the countless conversations we've all had with our parents, the lessons we carry forward.And let’s not forget her groundbreaking role as California’s Attorney General; she initiated programs that targeted systemic issues that affected countless communities. She’s not just a political figure; she’s a question mark in the history books. People often wonder what her next move will be. Do you think she’ll run for president in 2024? With her experience and influence, the stage is set for her to make even bolder moves. What do you think her legacy will look like in ten years?
