What was Donald Trump's approach to the economy during the pandemic?
    
Ah, Donald Trump! When I think of him, I can’t help but remember the first time I really tuned into his antics — it was during the 2016 election campaigns. He had this magnetism about him; whether folks loved him or hated him, everyone seemed to have a strong opinion. The way he talked, combining boastfulness with this almost theatrical flair, was something I’d never seen in a politician before.I remember scrolling through the news and being jolted awake by his sharp tweets — they were like mini hand grenades landing in a very serious political landscape. He had this knack for capturing attention, and the media was all too ready to report every word. At first, I was baffled by his style, but then I found it strangely captivating. It was like watching a train wreck; you knew you shouldn’t look away, yet you couldn’t help yourself.His rallies were something else entirely; an electrifying cocktail of fervor and chaos. The crowds were wild, chanting his name like he was a rock star. And then there was that infamous moment when he said he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and still not lose supporters. That sent chills down my spine, making me wonder — how far could this go?As much as one could find a lot of humor and absurdity in his approach, it left me with a haunting question: could he really tap into an undercurrent of discontent that would change everything? And if so, what would that mean for the future of politics? What do you think — did he reshape the political landscape for better or worse?
