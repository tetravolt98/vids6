What is Donald Trump's business background and experience?
    
Ah, Donald Trump! What a character! I remember the first time I really paid attention to him was during the 2016 election campaign. It was like watching a reality show unfold, only this was real life—with actual consequences. I vividly recall tuning in for a debate, and there he was, in his signature red tie and that unmistakable hairstyle, dominating the stage with an audacity I found both bewildering and oddly captivating.His style of speaking struck me; he didn’t mince words, which is rare in politics. He’d throw around phrases like “Make America Great Again” with such conviction that it felt like he was rallying an army. I still get a kick out of the fact that people were either staunchly against him or fervently supportive—there seemed to be no middle ground. At one point during the election, I hosted a gathering where friends were divided right down the line. I could feel the tension in the air as laughter and arguments danced around the popcorn bowl.But then came the aftermath of the election, with every twist and turn—the impeachment trials, the pandemic, and then the Capitol riots. It was like a rollercoaster ride that never quite ended. Sometimes, I find myself wondering how his presidency and style shaped the current political climate we live in. What impact will he continue to have on future generations? What happens next, especially as he hints at a 2024 run? Ah, it’s a wild ride, isn’t it? What do you think—can a figure like Trump ever really be out of the spotlight?
