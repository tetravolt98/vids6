What were the outcomes of Donald Trump’s trade policies?
    
Ah, Donald Trump! I remember the first time I really started paying attention to him. It was during the 2016 presidential race, and let me tell you, it felt like I was watching a reality show unfold in real time. He had this unique approach—so brash and unconventional. You’d see him strutting on stage with that signature red tie and the crowd just went wild. It was as if he thrived on the chaos he created.One moment that really stuck with me was during the debates. I was at a coffee shop, and the atmosphere was electric, almost tense. You could feel the people’s reactions—gasps, laughter, and sometimes even outrage. Everyone seemed to have a strong opinion, either cheering him on or vehemently opposing him. I remember someone at a nearby table shouting, “Is this really happening?” as he interrupted one of his opponents with that infamous one-liner.Now, it's not just his persona or his catchphrases that fascinated me, but the sheer divide he created in the audience. Friends became enemies, families were split right over dining tables. I felt like I was witnessing a national soap opera, and it made me question how far entertainment could intertwine with politics.But as I kept following his journey, especially after he took office, I wondered about the duality of it all: how he rallied so many, yet polarized just as many. Has politics forever changed with his influence? Or is there something deeper brewing beneath the surface of American ideals? What do you think will happen next?
