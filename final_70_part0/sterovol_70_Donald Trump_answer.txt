What role did reality TV play in Donald Trump's rise to fame?
    
Ah, Donald Trump – a figure who always sparks a range of opinions, doesn’t he? I remember the frenzy when he first announced his candidacy back in 2015. It felt like a reality TV show coming to life, his bombastic style and unfiltered tweets capturing public attention like nothing else. One evening, I was scrolling through Twitter, and I stumbled upon a live feed of one of his rallies. The energy in the air was palpable; it felt like I was at the center of a tug-of-war between fervent supporters and vocal protestors. What struck me the most was how polarized everyone seemed to be. You either loved him or absolutely couldn’t stand him. The charisma he had on stage was undeniable, but as I watched him, I also saw a man who had a knack for controversy. Whether it was about immigration, foreign policy, or the economy, he was always at the forefront of heated debates. Then, I watched the chaos unfold during the 2020 election. I remember the moment the results came in – it was like watching a plot twist in a thriller. I found myself glued to the screen, every second feeling heavier as the votes trickled in. The emotional highs and lows were enough to give anyone whiplash. And just when you think you've figured Donald Trump out, News breaks: he's always got another ace up his sleeve. What do you think is next for him? A comeback? Or perhaps a new venture altogether? The suspense of it all makes you wonder, what will he do next?
