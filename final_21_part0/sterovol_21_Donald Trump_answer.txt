What economic policies did Donald Trump push during his time in office?
    
Ah, Donald Trump! Honestly, I remember the first time I really tuned into one of his speeches. It was during the 2016 campaign, and I was glued to the TV, half-amused and half-intrigued. There was this undeniable energy, and his style was unlike anything I'd seen before in politics. The way he communicated—so direct, so unapologetic—was captivating, but it was also a bit surreal. It felt like I was watching a reality show unfold before my eyes. What really struck me was his ability to connect with people who felt overlooked. There were these crowds, massive and enthusiastic, hanging on his every word. I mean, one moment he’d be stirring up controversy, and the next, he’d bring people together with a rallying cry for change. It was a mix of admiration and disbelief, honestly. I found myself asking: How did a businessman with no prior political experience captivate millions? And then there’s the aftermath of his presidency—those tumultuous months filled with rallies, tweets, and, of course, that infamous Capitol incident. I still feel a knot in my stomach when I reflect on how charged the country became. As someone who usually steers clear of politics, it all felt like an emotional rollercoaster I didn’t sign up for. Now I’m left wondering, was he a brilliant strategist or just a product of circumstance? How much has his impact really changed the landscape of American politics for good? What do you think it means for future leaders?
