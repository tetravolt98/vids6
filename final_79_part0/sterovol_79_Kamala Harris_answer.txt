How has Kamala Harris reacted to the Supreme Court decisions?
    
You know, when I think of Kamala Harris, it’s hard not to remember this moment when I was watching the 2020 presidential debates. There she was, confidently delivering her signature blend of passion and intellect, and suddenly, she called out Joe Biden over his past stance on busing. My heart raced, partly because it was such an electrifying moment of confrontation, but also because it was a reminder of the power dynamics at play in American politics.I remember the excitement in the room—a bunch of my friends and I had gathered for a watch party. We were all quite engaged, but for a few minutes, when she spoke, it felt like time stood still. She had a way of grabbing your attention, weaving personal anecdotes seamlessly into her points. I found myself hanging onto her every word, as her background as a prosecutor added weight to her arguments. Her rise was nothing short of extraordinary, being the first female Vice President and the first woman of South Asian and African American descent to hold the office. It’s like we were witnessing history unfold right in front of us. But then there was a moment of uncertainty after the debates rolled on, as we all wondered if she’d stay in the race. Would she continue to break barriers, or would the pressures of the campaign trail take their toll?It’s those kinds of twists in her journey that leave me wondering—what will her legacy be? And how will the next generation of leaders rise in a world shaped by her trailblazing path?
