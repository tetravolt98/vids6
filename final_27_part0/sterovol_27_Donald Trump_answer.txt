What unique strategies did Donald Trump use in his campaigns?
    
Ah, Donald Trump! He’s such a polarizing figure, isn’t he? I still remember the first time I really paid attention to him—it was during the 2016 Presidential campaign. I was sitting in a café, sipping my coffee, when I overheard two groups at adjacent tables debating his every word. One side was buzzing with enthusiasm about his bold promises, while the other was expressing disbelief and frustration. It was like eavesdropping on a live political drama!What really struck me was how he used social media to connect with his followers. I mean, the way he turned Twitter into a platform for instant communication—who would’ve thought? I found it fascinating that someone could just fire off a tweet and spark such massive reactions. He seemed to thrive on controversy, which kept everyone talking. And then there were his rallies, where he would energize crowds with his charismatic speeches. I watched one livestream and could almost feel the palpable energy. People were chanting, and you could see a mix of hope, anger, and excitement in their faces. Whether you loved him or hated him, you couldn’t help but be captivated by the spectacle.But, amidst all this buzz, I often wondered—what goes on in his mind when he makes those impulsive decisions? Is it strategy, instinct, or something else entirely? The question lingers—what will his legacy truly be in the years to come?
