What were Donald Trump's most significant executive orders?
    
Ah, Donald Trump! You know, I remember the first time I really started paying attention to him. It was during the 2016 election, and I thought, “This guy is something else.” I mean, who else could burst onto the political scene with such unabashed confidence? I was sitting in a café, half-listening to the news, when I heard him say something outrageous about the election. I remember glancing up, half-expecting the anchor to break into laughter, but no—everyone was serious, glued to their screens. It was surreal.His rallies were a spectacle, like a rock concert mixed with a political event. The energy in the air was electric; people believed in him—or at least believed in what he was saying. You could feel their anger about the status quo, their desire for someone to shake things up. The more he riled up the crowd, the more I was fascinated. Yet, at the same time, I couldn’t help but think: Is this really what people want? And then, of course, there were the tweets. Oh man, those tweets! I’d wake up every morning, coffee in one hand, phone in the other, bracing myself for whatever wild headline would emerge. I was hooked; it was like I was waiting for the next episode of some thrilling series.But here’s the twist: despite all the noise, I often wondered, where is this all leading us? With his tenure, the divisions in America seemed to deepen, and I often pondered, will we ever find common ground again? What do you think? Where do you see this heading?
