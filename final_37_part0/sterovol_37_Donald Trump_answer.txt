What was Donald Trump's relationship with the Republican Party?
    
Ah, Donald Trump—what a character! I remember the first time I really sat down to watch him speak, it was during one of his rallies leading up to the 2016 election. I could hardly believe my eyes as he strode across the stage, exuding confidence and igniting the crowd with every bold statement. It felt like I was witnessing a live performance, almost like a reality show—but this was real life. His ability to flip traditional political norms on their heads was both astonishing and bewildering. At one moment he’d be criticizing the media, and the next, he’d be engaging with supporters, rallying them with chants that seemed to echo the fervor of the crowd. I found myself torn between admiration for his showmanship and skepticism about the messages he was delivering.But what struck me the most was his use of social media. The man was practically revolutionizing communication with his Twitter account, turning it into a direct line to millions. It was almost thrilling to watch as the news cycle would spin around his latest tweet—his influence was palpable.Yet, while everyone was captivated by his larger-than-life persona, I couldn’t shake the feeling that it was all just the tip of the iceberg. What really lay beneath that flashy surface? And as we know now, the tides have shifted since those days. With all the controversies surrounding his presidency and ongoing legal battles, one can’t help but wonder—where does he go from here? Will we see a political comeback, or has the world truly moved on? What do you think?
