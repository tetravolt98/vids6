How does Donald Trump view his impact on the media?
    
You know, when I think of Donald Trump, I can't help but remember this one time I was at a crowded restaurant during the 2016 election season. You could literally feel the tension in the air, with friends on either side of the political spectrum passionately arguing over their views. Suddenly, a table nearby erupted with a shout, “Trump is going to save America!” It caught everyone’s attention, and I watched as a heated debate unfolded, emotions running high.That was when it hit me just how polarizing he is. I mean, you either love him or you can’t stand him, right? His larger-than-life persona, the way he handled rallies like rock concerts, and his tweets that had the power to cause markets to fluctuate overnight—it was all a wild ride. He’s like this lightning rod, drawing in crowds, and at the same time, igniting fierce opposition.Yet, what’s fascinating is how he continues to evolve. Even after his presidency, he still dominates headlines and conversations. I was at a fair just last summer when a group of people started talking about the possibility of him running again in 2024. The energy was palpable—some were excited, some were outraged. It was a microcosm of the national conversation. As I stood there listening, it made me wonder: with such a divided nation, could he truly galvanize the same support again, or would his controversial past alienate him further? What’s your take on his potential comeback? Would it be a triumph or a disaster?
