What is Donald Trump's opinion on trade agreements?
    
When I think of Donald Trump, I can’t help but recall the first time he really burst onto my radar, back when “The Apprentice” was all the rage. I remember sitting in my college dorm, watching him crack that iconic catchphrase, "You're fired!" It felt electrifying, like we were getting a front-row seat to the machinations of a high-stakes business world. I found myself drawn in, not just by the show, but by the larger-than-life persona that he projected. He was confident, brash, and oddly compelling.As I followed his career through real estate, television, and ultimately politics, I saw a figure who sparked passion in both his supporters and critics alike. During his presidency, I often found myself in heated discussions with friends and family—some were ardent supporters, while others were vehemently opposed. The debates became a backdrop to our lives; each news cycle felt like a rollercoaster ride.One moment that stands out was his response to the COVID-19 pandemic. I was glued to the news, trying to make sense of it all, and there he was, presenting updates with that unmistakable bravado. Yet the surreal disparity between his upbeat messages and the grim realities on the ground made my heart race. Sometimes I wonder what drives someone like Trump—a mix of ambition, controversy, and charisma that keeps people engaged, even polarized. What’s next for him? Will he continue to shape American politics or fade into the background? The speculation is endless, and honestly, I can’t help but be curious. What do you think?
