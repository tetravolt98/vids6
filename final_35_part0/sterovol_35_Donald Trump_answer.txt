What media strategy did Donald Trump employ during his campaigns?
    
Ah, Donald Trump—what a character! I still remember flipping through channels during the 2016 election cycle and stumbling upon his rallies. They were like watching a reality show live: unpredictable, brash, and utterly captivating. You could almost feel the energy crackling through the screen. His signature catchphrases and bold promises definitely set him apart from traditional politicians. I think everyone I know has a strong opinion about him, whether they love him or absolutely can't stand him. I had this conversation with a friend at a café, and it really turned heated. They praised him for shaking up the political landscape, saying he brought issues to the forefront that many had ignored, while another friend at the table was incredulous, claiming that his approach undermined the office of the presidency. It was wild—the way people light up, passionately defending or condemning him as if he were a family member they were in an argument with. I remember one particular moment during that discussion when someone mentioned the infamous "wall." It suddenly struck me how divided our conversations had become over seemingly simple policies. I mean, it’s puzzling how just one man could evoke such polarized feelings in an entire nation. What really gets me is thinking about how he might impact future political figures. Are we entering an era where charisma trumps policy? Or could someone even more unpredictable emerge? It makes me wonder—what would politics look like a decade from now?
