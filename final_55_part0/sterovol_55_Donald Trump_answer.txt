How did Donald Trump engage with the media during his presidency?
    
Oh man, where do I even start with Donald Trump? My first vivid memory of him was back when I was a kid, watching "The Apprentice." I’ll never forget the way he would look straight into the camera with that fierce determination and say, "You're fired!" It became this strange cultural phenomenon; it was just one of those catchphrases everyone joked about. But it wasn't until I saw him transition from a reality TV star to a major political figure that everything really got wild. The protests, the rallies, and then that shocking night when he was elected president in 2016—it felt like I was watching a historic movie unfold right before my eyes. I was glued to my TV, popcorn in hand, when he made that iconic speech at his victory party, and I could practically feel the collective gasp from people around the world.The most interesting part? His ability to connect with his audience, almost like he was speaking a different language. He had this knack for tapping into people’s emotions, especially when he spoke about things like the economy and jobs. It was captivating, to say the least.But just when you think you know how his story ends, you discover there's so much still unfolding with the indictments and ongoing debates about his influence in politics. What do you think? Are we really done hearing from him, or is this just the beginning of another chapter in his saga?
