What businesses did Donald Trump own before entering politics?
    
Oh, where do I even start with Donald Trump? The first time I really paid attention to him was during the early days of his presidency. I remember sitting in a crowded café, nervously sipping my coffee while trying to catch the latest news on my phone. Everyone was buzzing, some in support and others vehemently against him. It felt like a divide that wasn't just political, but personal. One moment that really struck me was when he held that infamous press conference after the Charlottesville rally. I vividly recall the tension in the room, the journalists leaning in, pens poised over notebooks. His words felt electric, sparking an intense reaction. Some were in disbelief, while others cheered him on. It got me thinking—here was a man who stirred such passion, and I found myself caught between admiration and frustration.What's fascinating is not just his policies but how he has become a cultural phenomenon. I sometimes wonder what makes him so captivating, drawing people in like a moth to a flame. His signature style, brash tweets, and that trademark hair—there’s just something almost theatrical about it all. And here’s the kicker: even as he remains a polarizing figure, there's a part of me that is genuinely curious about what his next move will be. Will he run again? How will the landscape of American politics change? It’s like a gripping drama unfolding before our eyes. What about you? What’s your take on the Trump phenomenon—do you find it fascinating or frustrating?
