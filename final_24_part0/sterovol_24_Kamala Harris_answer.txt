What are the major themes in Kamala Harris's speeches?
    
Oh, Kamala Harris! I remember when she first captivated the nation during her presidential run. I was sitting on my couch, popcorn in hand, completely entranced as she delivered her powerful speeches. It's hard not to admire her journey, from being the first female District Attorney of San Francisco to the first Black and Indian American woman as VP. What struck me most was her authenticity. I remember one debate when she shared her childhood experience facing the same issues many Americans face. Her passionate recounting of her mother’s struggles as an immigrant really pierced through the political facade, connecting with people on a personal level. I felt like I was witnessing a moment of history, where vulnerability and strength collided in such a real way.But there was this one moment that I can't shake off. During an interview about policy changes, she confidently spoke about criminal justice reform, her voice unwavering. The tension in the room was palpable. Critics had doubts about her past as a prosecutor, and as she answered, I could feel the weight of the questions hanging in the air. Would she address those concerns head-on? It made me wonder—can you truly break away from past decisions, or do they define your present? As I sat there, caught in the suspense of her response, I realized just how complex her role is. As she continues to navigate her political career, what do you think is the most pressing issue she faces next?
