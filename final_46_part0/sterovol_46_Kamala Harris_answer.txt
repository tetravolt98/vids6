What does Kamala Harris advocate for regarding student loan debt?
    
Ah, Kamala Harris! You know, what stands out to me the most about her is her remarkable journey. I remember the first time I truly paid attention to her during the 2016 Senate race in California. Her charisma was palpable! There she was, poised, intelligent, and tackling the tough questions with such ease. I can still picture her on stage, taking a deep breath before delivering a powerful rebuttal to her opponent. It resonated with me because it was a stark reminder of how far she'd come from her days as a district attorney.Back then, I was fascinated not only by her politics but also by her personal story. Kamala has roots in both India and Jamaica—how cool is that? It was like living proof that the American dream is alive and well. Yet, what really made me sit up and take notice was her poise during the Senate hearings for then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. The way she strategically dissected his testimony was almost theatrical, revealing her sharp intellect and investigative skills.However, not everyone agrees with her approach, and I can't help but wonder how she feels about the backlash she's faced. The pressure of being the first woman of South Asian descent in such a pivotal role must be overwhelming at times. I'm curious, do you think she’ll continue to break barriers or will she face challenges that will redefine her political path? What would you ask her if you had the chance?
